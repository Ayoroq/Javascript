“I figuratively can’t because I have to finish this thing for school.” regardless of 
what their parents say, they  want to do what they want, which is somewhat annoying. 
I’ve heard some of them say, “I ain’t going to listen, I should have gone out yesterday, 
but I was busy with effective projects that were  very impressive.” supposedly, 
they received separate invitations, but anyway, they can’t go now. One of them said, 
“I’m going to use my time better next week and be more effective,” but I doubt it. definitely, 
they could have planned better, but they  didn’t. , they  can’t get organized, 
and that’s the thing that bothers me the most.


regardless of how effective the meeting was, a lot of people  didn’t pay 
attention and were  distracted by other materials. One person figuratively said,
“I ain’t going to do this thing because I have to finish something else, and anyway, 
I  want to go home.” supposedly, they received separate emails, but some children still didn’t show up. 
“I’m going to use my time better next week,” one of them claimed, 
but I doubt it because they always say they’re going to change and never do. 
definitely, they could have tried harder, but they  can’t seem to focus. 
, it’s somewhat frustrating to watch, and very few people seem to care. 
“should have, would have, could have,” they say, but in the end, nothing gets done.
