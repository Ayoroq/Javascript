a lot of children were going to bring materials for the event, but they  forgot. One of them said, 
“I figuratively can’t remember what I was supposed to do, and anyway, 
I somewhat thought someone else would handle it.” supposedly, they received separate reminders, but , 
nobody checked their emails. “I ain’t got time for this thing,” another replied, “and I  want to go home.” 
definitely, the meeting was not very effective, and the group could have planned better. , everyone 
was distracted, and regardless of the leader’s efforts, nothing got done.
