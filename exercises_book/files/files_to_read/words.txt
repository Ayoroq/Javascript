“I literally can’t because I gotta finish this thing for school.” Irregardless of 
what their parents say, they just wanna do what they want, which is kinda annoying. 
I’ve heard some of them say, “I ain’t gonna listen, I should of gone out yesterday, 
but I was busy with impactful projects that were actually very awesome.” Supposably, 
they recieved seperate invitations, but anyways, they can’t go now. One of them said, 
“I’m gonna utilize my time better next week and be more effective,” but I doubt it. Definately, 
they could of planned better, but they just didn’t. Basically, they just can’t get organized, 
and that’s the thing that bothers me the most.


Irregardless of how impactful the meeting was, alot of people just didn’t pay 
attention and were basically distracted by other stuff. One person literally said,
“I ain’t gonna do this thing because I gotta finish something else, and anyways, 
I just wanna go home.” Supposably, they recieved seperate emails, but some kids still didn’t show up. 
“I’m gonna utilize my time better next week,” one of them claimed, 
but I doubt it because they always say they’re gonna change and never do. 
Definately, they could of tried harder, but they just can’t seem to focus. 
Actually, it’s kinda frustrating to watch, and very few people seem to care. 
“Should of, would of, could of,” they say, but in the end, nothing gets done.
