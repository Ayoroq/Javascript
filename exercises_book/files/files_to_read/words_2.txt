Alot of kids were gonna bring stuff for the event, but they just forgot. One of them said, 
“I literally can’t remember what I was supposed to do, and anyways, 
I kinda thought someone else would handle it.” Supposably, they recieved seperate reminders, but actually, 
nobody checked their emails. “I ain’t got time for this thing,” another replied, “and I just wanna go home.” 
Definately, the meeting was not very effective, and the group could of planned better. Basically, everyone 
was distracted, and irregardless of the leader’s efforts, nothing got done.
